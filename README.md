# Ceramic-Tile-Surface-Defects-Classifier
Image analytics-based solution to classify salient surface defects in ceramic tiles.

## Product overview
Surface defects in ceramic tiles pose aesthetic and structural problems. Classifying defects enables for the rapid identification and removal of the causes of their occurrence, as well as the provision of appropriate treatments to fix them. This Deep Learning-based solution identifies three classes of salient surface defects: pin-holes (i.e., tiny holes), holes, and prominent cracks in them. This solution analyses the user-provided image data, identifies the best performing deep learning model architecture, and predicts the defect class with the highest probability score. This can assist ceramic tile manufacturing companies to improve their quality control process.

## Product Highlight 
* This solution identifies three types of surface defects in ceramic tiles: pin-holes, holes, and visible cracks. This solution can assist ceramic tile manufacturing companies to improve their quality control process.
* This solution analyses flat surface images of ceramic tiles and identifies the best performing deep learning model architecture for defect classification. This solution improves the turnaround time for developing AI-powered visual inspection systems.
* Mphasis DeepInsights is a cloud-based cognitive computing platform that offers data extraction & predictive analytics capabilities. Need Customized Deep learning and Machine Learning Solutions? Get in Touch!
